                        <p> I am a Computer Programming student at Georgian College. In addition to my
                            current studies, I've completed a Project Management Certificate at Simon Fraser University,
                            and
                            a Bachelor's Degree in Global Development from Queen's University. I have also been
                            fortunate
                            enough to participate in two student exchanges, and Iâ€™ve studied in Belgium and Singapore.
                        </p>
                        <p>As pertains to employment, I have worked in administrative support positions at the Vancouver
                            Fraser Port Authority, Simon Fraser University, and several other organizations, both
                            locally
                            and
                            out west. After growing up in Ontario, I moved to British Columbia for seven years, and then
                            eventually moved back home again to be closer to family. I started coding as a hobby,
                            quickly
                            fell in love with it, and decided to pursue further studies and move into programming as a
                            career.</p>
